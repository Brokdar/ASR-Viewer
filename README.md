# ASR_Viewer
This application displays the content of ARXML files. ARXML stands for AUTOSAR XML Schema and is an XML language definition for exchanging AUTOSAR models and descriptions. The goal of this application is to provide comfortable views of the content so that the user can easily analyize and oversee the configurations. If there's no fitting view the user can extend the application by adding a plugin with the needed view. Also it's possible to provide your own views by writing a plugin in C#.
